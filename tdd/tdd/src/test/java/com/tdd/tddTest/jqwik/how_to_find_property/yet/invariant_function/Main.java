    Some properties of our code do not change after applying our logic. For example:

    Sorting and mapping should never change the size of a collection.
    After filtering out some values, the remaining values should still be in the original order.
    When you use stateful objects in sets or as keys in maps, whatever you do with them should never change their hash value.
