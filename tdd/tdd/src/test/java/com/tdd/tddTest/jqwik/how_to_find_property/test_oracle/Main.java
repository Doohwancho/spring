    Sometimes we know of an alternative implementation for our function or algorithm which is called a test oracle. In this case any result of using the function should be the same for both original and alternative. There are a few sources where the alternatives can come from:

    Simple and slow versus complicated but fast
    Parallel versus single-threaded
    Self-made versus commercial
    Old (pre-refactoring) versus new (post-refactoring)
