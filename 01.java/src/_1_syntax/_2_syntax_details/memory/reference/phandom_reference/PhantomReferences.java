/*

  A phantom reference is quite different from either soft or weak references.
  Its grip on its object is so tenuous that you can't even retrieve the object --
  its get() method always returns null.
  The only use for such a reference is keeping track of when it gets enqueued into a ReferenceQueue,
  as at that point you know the object to which it pointed is dead.


  Phantom references are objects that can be collected whenever the collector likes.
  The object reference is appended to a ReferenceQueue and you can use this to clean up after a collection.
  This is an alternative to the finalize() method and is slightly safer because the finalize() method may ressurect the object by creating new strong references.
  The PhantomReference however cleans up the object and enqueues the reference object to a ReferenceQueue that a class can use for clean up.
