myth of clean code by Traversy Media


1. clean code is subjective to individual developer. therefore, make consensus before collaboration, and stick to it.
2. clean code can be a gatekeeper to actually write code 
3. yes there are best practices, but clean code is highly context-based. some are just trolls, many are just different style of writing code
