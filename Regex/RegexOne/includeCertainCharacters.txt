match 
1. abcdefg
2. abcde
3. abc

answer: abc(.*)

why?

abc : letters in common
() : group-ing
. : any character
* : zero or more repetition

Q1. why * instead of +?
because + works when there is one or more repetitions,
and 3rd example(abc) has no letter or digits after 'c'

if you want to use '+' sign, there must be at least single character after 'c'
